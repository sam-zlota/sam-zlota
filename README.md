# Project Overview

## AI/ML (Python)
 - #### [MinimaxML Chess Engine](https://github.com/sam-zlota/chess-engine)
A chess engine built on the adversarial search minimax algorithm with alphabeta pruning that selects moves using a logistic regression model for Artificial Intelligence (CS 4100) final project
 - #### [COVID Lung Scan Classifier using CNNs](https://github.com/sam-zlota/covid-lung-scan-classifer)
Generated image classification model from dataset of 2431 COVID and 2166 NON-COVID CT scans using deep transfer learning and convolutional neural networks with best scores on test set: recall .98, F1 .91, accuracy .90, precision .90, and specificity .89. 
 - #### [Spotify Song Popularity Predictor](https://github.com/sam-zlota/spotify-song-popularity-predictor)
Constructed dataset of 10,000 songs and associated features (speechiness, danceability, etc.) from Spotify API to train three regression models to predict popularity score with best R-squared value of 0.64 and MSE 0.50. Wrote extensive report detailing rigorous data transformation, exploratory data analysis, and overall performance of models.
